With over two decades of experience in manufacturing, I’ve led teams and launched products in the automotive and aerospace industries — from assembly to maintenance. I’m currently disabled and retired due to a car accident. I’m familiar with many industry certifications and systems, including Six Sigma, 5S, ISO 9000, and NADCAP. I also earned a programming degree from an accredited college.

With my machining, welding, and maintenance experience, I maintain a small tube-bending and manufacturing facility, advise early-stage projects and startups on product development and manufacturing strategy — from precise engineering drawings to specifications — and mentor aspiring project leads. I enjoy engineering, experimenting, and helping others build with more clarity, confidence, and care.
